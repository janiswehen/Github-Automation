## GitHub Workflows

Our repository employs two primary categories of GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI) Workflows**: These workflows are responsible for building, testing, and validating the codebase.
2. **GitHub Automation**: Prefixed by `ga_`, these workflows are designed to automate various GitHub-related tasks, enhancing the efficiency of our repository management.

### GitHub Automation Workflows:

1. **`ga_issue_in_progress.yml`**:

    - **Function**: Automatically moves an issue to the `🏗️ In Progress` column on the project board.
    - **Trigger**: When a new branch is created with the issue number as its prefix.

2. **`ga_issue_in_review.yml`**:

    - **Function**: Automatically moves an issue to the `🔍 In Review` column on the project board.
    - **Trigger**: When a new PR is created that references an existing issue. (Not draft PR)

3. **`ga_pr_development_status.yml`**:

    - **Function**: Assigns a pull request (PR) to either the `🏗️ Development`, `✨ Merged` or `🕵️ Ready for Test Review` column based on its status.
    - **Trigger**: Based on whether the PR is a draft, merged or ready for review.

4. **`ga_release_labeler.yml`**:

    - **Function**: Adds a `⚠ Release` label to a PR, and its associated issue if it exists.
    - **Trigger**: When a PR is created with the `release` branch as its base.

5. **`ga_transfer_issue_data.yml`**:

    - **Function**: Copies all labels and assignees from an issue to its corresponding PR when the PR is created.
    - **Trigger**: Creation of a PR that references an existing issue.

### Scripts Folder

The `scripts` folder contains essential scripts that these workflows leverage for execution. Dive into this folder to understand the underlying operations that support our workflows.

Please refer to the individual workflow files and scripts for more specific details on their operations and configurations.
